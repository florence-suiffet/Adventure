				<p>1 hour flight to London and then 9 hours flight from London to Mexico City. If you get there early the total will be less than 800 euros without hold luggage. </p>

				<h2>Means of transport available in Mexico</h2>

				<h3>Bus Mexico City - Puerto Escondido/Oaxaca</h3>
				<p>You can of course travel around Mexico by bus, to do Mexico City - Puerto Escondido / Oaxaca, count on about 15 hours of bus and about 50 euros round trip</p>
			
				<h3>Bus within Oaxaca</h3>
				<p>In almost all regions of Mexico, the most common mode of transport is the bus, el colectivo, because it is cheap and because the terrain is quite different, it is often the only way to get around. The buses are very comfortable and it is possible to recline the seat to be able to sleep, which makes the tens of hours of bus travel pleasant. In the Oaxaca region you will need to take the bus to get to interesting places. This will cost you about 10 euros round trip.</p>

				<h3>Metro in Mexico City</h3>
				<p>It is the best way to get around the city. Its network is large enough to get you to the areas that visitors need to explore. It is fast, cheap, well connected and easy to use. You can buy single tickets (5 pesos) at any station, or a rechargeable card for an extra 10 pesos (this card can also be used on the Metrob√∫s).</p>
				
				<h3>Uber and Cabify</h3>
				<p>Both Uber and Cabify are excellent options for private transportation in the city. Compared to rates in the US and Europe, Mexico's are very cheap and the service is very good. If you are a woman and don't feel safe using Uber or Cabify, try Laudrive - it provides services exclusively for women.</p>

				<h3>Regular buses</h3>
				<p>Better known as "peceros", they are everywhere in the city but are the last option I recommend for getting around Mexico City. They are old, the operators drive very badly and they change their routes at will (not that common, but it happens). Even the locals get lost, so it's not a recommended way to get around if you're a first time visitor. </p>
